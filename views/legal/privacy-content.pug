    li sharing such information with other users of the Service within the settings of the Service;
    li disclosure to our employees, consultants, contractors, business partners, service providers and suppliers, on a need to know basis.

Such ads may be based on the information provided to us, other than the PII. We do not provide any PII to such advertising agencies and networks. However, please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain type of users or audience, and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. This Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of third-party advertisers. Any solicitation of personal information through such advertisements is strictly between the advertiser and you.
p You may choose voluntarily whether or not to provide us with your PII.
